# Clone Graph
# Given a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy of the graph.
#
# Each node in the graph contains an integer value and a list of its neighbors.
#
# class Node {
#     public int val;
#     public List<Node> neighbors;
# }
# The graph is shown in the test cases as an adjacency list. An adjacency list is a mapping of nodes to lists, used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
#
# For simplicity, nodes values are numbered from 1 to n, where n is the total number of nodes in the graph. The index of each node within the adjacency list is the same as the node's value (1-indexed).
#
# The input node will always be the first node in the graph and have 1 as the value.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
#
# Input: adjList = [[2],[1,3],[2]]
#
# Output: [[2],[1,3],[2]]
# Explanation: There are 3 nodes in the graph.
# Node 1: val = 1 and neighbors = [2].
# Node 2: val = 2 and neighbors = [1, 3].
# Node 3: val = 3 and neighbors = [2].
#
# Example 2:
#
#
#
# Input: adjList = [[]]
#
# Output: [[]]
# Explanation: The graph has one node with no neighbors.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: adjList = []
#
# Output: []
# Explanation: The graph is empty.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 0 <= The number of nodes in the graph <= 100.
# 1 <= Node.val <= 100
# There are no duplicate edges and no self-loops in the graph.
